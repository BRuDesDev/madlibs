MADLIBS
</h1>


Madlibs game created using Python and HermanFasset API.<br>
Currently, game is played in the terminal (a gui version will come soon). You will be prompted to enter a word of a particular type:<br>
Some of these types include:<br><br>
<b>Noun</b>- _a word or phrase that is the name of something (as a person, place, or thing) and that is used in a sentence especially as subject or object of a verb or as object of a preposition._ <br> 
<b>Verb</b>- _words that show an action (sing), occurrence (develop), or state of being (exist)._<br>
<b>Adjective</b>- _words that are used to describe or modify nouns or pronouns. For example, red, quick, happy, and obnoxious are adjectives because they can describe things_<br>
<b>Adverb</b>- _a word used to modify a verb, an adjective, or another adverb and often used to show degree, manner, place, or time._ <br>
<b>Pronoun</b>- _a type of word that replaces a noun (reminder, a noun is a person, place, or thing). Pronouns are words like she, you, him, them, this, and who, etc..._<br><br>

When you have given all your words, your story will appear with the blanks replaced with your input. Read it and have a laugh.
